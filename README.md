 # Insurance_Cost_Prediction

This project is mainly about the medical insurance cost prediction with the help of designing Linear Regression Model.

 The dataset for the model has been collected from the Kaggle Datasets. 
   
    
At First, I have imported the necessary libraries for the data cleaning and the data visualizations like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
   
Then I uploaded the downloaded CSV file named "insurance.csv" into the Program, next the checking and deletion of the abnormalities of the data was done because this will lead to decrease the accuracy of the model which wii be created using this data
   
Then I have seperated the data into numerical and Categorial Data for the model creation, then the Various Graphs have been plotted by the nature of the columns of the data.
    
Then the model creation was starts, I've changed the categorial values like  "Sex, Smoker, Region" Values into the numerical values for the model development.
    
  The splitting of the training and testing data was done by 80% for training data and remaining 20% for the testing data.

   Then the Feature scaling was done on the age, children and BMI.

   Then the linear Regression Model develops starts, the trained data was fit in the linear regression model and the prediction was done by using Linear regression model.

   The accuracy for the Model was obtained as 80.68%
